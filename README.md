DeFi - Decentralized Finance is a new standard in the e-commerce world, evolving within the framework of the Web 3.0 concept. In April 2021, the capitalization of DeFi projects reached an incredible $60 billion.

Arabic Cash technology is based on the DeFi principle. This creates a competitive alternative to traditional banking services. Now, to access your finances, you don't need to contact the bank, pay huge service fees and spend a lot of time processing transactions. Your assets only belong to you. In addition, blockchain technology is capable of storing your data forever, and it cannot be tampered with.

The most important argument in favor of Arabic Cash is that smart contracts were created in the most modern Solidity programming language of the BEP20 protocol on the Binance blockchain. This indicates the maximum protection against hacking, as well as the minimum transfer fees. For example, transferring $1,000,000 to another account will take less than a minute, and the commission will be only $0.2.
