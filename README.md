# Technology DeFi

DeFi - Decentralized Finance is a new standard in the e-commerce world, evolving within the framework of the Web 3.0 concept. In April 2021, the capitalization of DeFi projects reached an incredible $60 billion.

Arabic Cash technology is based on the DeFi principle. This creates a competitive alternative to traditional banking services. Now, to access your finances, you don't need to contact the bank, pay huge service fees and spend a lot of time processing transactions. Your assets only belong to you. In addition, blockchain technology is capable of storing your data forever, and it cannot be tampered with.

The most important argument in favor of Arabic Cash is that smart contracts were created in the most modern Solidity programming language of the BEP20 protocol on the Binance blockchain. This indicates the maximum protection against hacking, as well as the minimum transfer fees. For example, transferring $1,000,000 to another account will take less than a minute, and the commission will be only $0.2.

# Global solutions


Arabic Cash is the world's first independent decentralized financial instrument based on loans and deposits backed by Arab capital. It aims to attract new investments in the development of the digital economy of the Arab world.

Recently, excessive bureaucracy and complex financial monitoring of the Eastern region, like a giant dam, have blocked investment flows from all over the world. Arabic Cash is now ready to make a difference. Now any inhabitant of the planet can invest in the rapidly developing countries of the Eastern region. All investments accumulate in the decentralized Binance Smart Chain - the most reliable and profitable e-commerce platform to date.

With Arabic Cash technology, the world will have revolutionary tools for doing business. The official ABIC token allows you to make money transfers in large volumes, which is now necessary for business in the Arab countries. The ArabicSwap Decentralized Exchange allows you to preserve assets and generate passive income that no other bank can match. And the CryptoBank phenomenon will solve the global issues of lending to large financial sectors without the participation of intermediaries.

All of this will eventually turn into a large-scale financial ecosystem that can become a real phenomenon in a rapidly changing world.
